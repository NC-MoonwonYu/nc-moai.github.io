Commit test version v03.07.1045
We present a machine learning technique for driving 3D facial animation
by audio input in real time and with low latency. Our deep neural network
learns a mapping from input waveforms to the 3D vertex coordinates of
a face model, and simultaneously discovers a compact, latent code that
disambiguates the variations in facial expression that cannot be explained by
the audio alone.
