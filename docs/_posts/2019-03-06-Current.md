A custom map created by Drodo Games for Dota 2, Auto Chess is a game that emphasises fast and fluid gameplay that simultaneously avoids the emphasis on APM and twitch-like reflexes. How you play your pieces matters far more than how fast you can click! As a custom mode, it's available for free from the Steam Workshop.
